### Abstract
Many cells employ cadherin complexes (c-sites) on the cell membrane to attach to neighboring cells, as well as integrin complexes (i-sites) to attach to a substrate in order to accomplish cell migration.
This paper analyzes a model for the motion of a group of cells connected by c-sites.
We begin with two cells connected by a single c-site and analyze the resultant motion of the system.
We find that the system is irrotational.
We present a result for reducing the number of c-sites in a system with c-sites between pairs of cells.
This greatly simplifies the general system and provides an exact solution for the motion of a system of two cells and several c-sites.

### Abstract
In this report I apply a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique
to the problem of estimating an autoregressive (AR) model to data. In doing this I focus on
the proposed poles of the AR model. A review of relevant background material is included.
And a full specification of the implementation is provided. At this time the attempt has
been unsuccessful and only partial results are reported.

### Abstract
Most of my talk will be about my dissertation work at a fairly high level, the target audience being around the level of a senior undergraduate math major. Though to do it any justice, I will need to get a bit technical for what I hope is not too long. I plan on mentioning applications and ways undergrads can get involved with this sort of research. Then in the last 10 or so minutes I discuss the research I hope to pursue after graduation and emphasize undergraduate research opportunities within that research as well. I also provide a brief summary of my teaching background, mention classes I would like to teach, and say a few words about my vision for a math program at SVU.

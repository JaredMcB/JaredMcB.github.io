Welcome to vector calculus! This course is designed as a complement to Math 223. Students enrolled in the course will participate in a weekly problem session pertaining to material covered in Math 223. Concurrent registration in Math 223 is required.

Each week the class is divided into groups and a worksheet is handed out. Each group is assigned a problem from the worksheet which they will be responsible for presenting. After an hour or so, presentations begin. The worksheets are below.  Class meetings that immediately preceded an exam are review sessions.

Handouts
=====
[Major Theorems Cheat Sheet](/files/teaching/files-2021-fall-M196V/MajorTheoremSheet.pdf) This is a handout to help students remember the higher dimensional versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Green's, Stokes', Divergence, etc.) Please let me know if you have a suggestion to improve clarity.

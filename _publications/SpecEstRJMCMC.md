excerpt: 'The present work serves as a stepping stone to the task of rational spectral approximation given signal observations. Rational approximations can be preferred over the common Laurent polynomial approximation since they often can achieve great accuracy with much fewer parameters. The task of Rational approximation is essentially that of ARMA fitting. And the hope of this work is to provide guidance for solving that problem by first considering AR fitting by reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo over the space of poles and error variance, which things determine the centered AR process. In a sense this is a proof of concept or trial run to understand the problem well enough to better determine whether the full ARMA problem is worthwhile.'

## Abstract

In this report I apply a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique
to the problem of estimating an autoregressive (AR) model to data. In doing this I focus on
the proposed poles of the AR model. A review of relevant background material is included.
And a full specification of the implementation is provided. At this time the attempt has
been unsuccessful and only partial results are reported.

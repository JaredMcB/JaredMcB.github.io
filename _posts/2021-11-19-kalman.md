Here I explore the Kalman filter. I am seeking an intuitive, conceptually if not geometric understanding of the Kalman gain matrix.

## Literature Search
I start by reading some popular explanations. The first thing I found was this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/yet-another-kalman-filter-explanation-article-be0264d99937) by a data scientist named Ben Ogorek. He pointed me to a popular [stack exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/840662/an-explanation-of-the-kalman-filter) question and recommend and answer that the author (of the answer) posted on his own website. The article can be found [here](https://david.wf/kalmanfilter/).

[Here](https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/) is a article with pictures.

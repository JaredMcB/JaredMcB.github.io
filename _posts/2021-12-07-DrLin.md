Had a brief meeting and reiterated points from last time.

Today we meet came up with the following tasks for me to do:
 * [ ] Write a note on spectral factorization using the Kalman filter. This will be nice to have down in a clear, concise yet comprehensive way using consistent notation. I will include a description of the Kalman filter and where possible include intuition that may be useful.
   - How do we go from the Kalman gain matrix to the model filter.
 * [ ] Email spectral estimation guy. Near the end of the this week. Like Friday.
 * [ ] Address this question: What information is missed after a single stage of whitening? We will have to explain why iterative whitening works. Additionally,  I would like to repeat the experiment from [here](files\research\references\MESA-a case study--Martini+Schmidt+DelPozzo.pdf). That is, run 1000 realizations of a Gaussian process (or a harder process) and use this method to get a variance for the estimate of the power spectrum.  
   - Can I make an example that requires more whitening, say, an arbitrary number of stages.
 * [ ] Write up a basic Kalman filter implementation and make sure it gets the same result as CKMS.
 * [ ] Clean up areas in code in which inverses are taken.

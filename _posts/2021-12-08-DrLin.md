I am perhaps trying to be too technical. By I am curious, even if this doesn't belong in the note that I am writing about spectral factorization. In the context of a state-space model,

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
\theta_{i+1} &= F_i\theta_i + G_iu_i \\
X_i &= H_i\theta_i + v_i
\end{array}
\right.
$$

I have the state random variables $\theta_i \in \mathbb{C}^m$ and observations $X_i \in \mathbb{C}^d$. I want to condition the state variable $\theta_i$ on the observation $X_j$. I would like to think of this geometrically. And  I am wondering what is going on formally, when I project the state onto the observation. 
I would like to write

$$
\hat{\theta}_i = \mathbb{E}[\theta_i | X_j] = \langle \theta_i, X_j \rangle R^{-1}_{X,j}X_j
$$

where $\langle x,y \rangle = \mathbb{E} xy^*$ and $R_{X,j} = \langle X_j,X_j \rangle$ and say I am projecting $\theta_i$ onto $\text{span}(X_j)$. But, I am discouraged from doing so since in (2) $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle$ is not an inner-product and these variables, though are over the same probability space, are not in a common module or Hilbert space.

My question is if you know of...
